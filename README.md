# machine-learning-stanford-coursera-assignments
### This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition using GNU Octave:
- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
- Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI)
